The Leksah Project
==================
** These docs are outdated, we are working on getting them up-to-date for the next release**

The development of an integrated Development Environment is a major
undertaking and Leksah should become increasingly supported by the user
community. If you are a user or just test Leksah, we would appreciate to
here from you. Do not miss to report bugs, unclear or wrong information
in the documentation and suggestion for improvements on the Leksah issue
tracker.

Everyone is invited to contribute. Spreading the word, supplying error
reports, providing keymap and candy files, providing a tutorial, caring
for a platform will develop are all helpful and meaningful ways to
contribute.

Leksah will advance over time and become more useful. Possible extension
and enhancements are:

-  Package editor with configurations

-  Add traces to the Debugger

-  Support for some kind of plug-ins or extensions

-  Context enriched completion

-  Version Control (Darcs, ...)

-  Testing (Quick check,...)

-  Object browser

-  Coverage (HPC,...)

-  Profiling (Ghc Profiler,...)

-  Re-factoring (HaRe,...)

-  FAD (Functional Analysis and Design,...)
