\begin_layout Section
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah is an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) for the programming
 language Haskell.
 It is written in Haskell.
 Leksah is intended as a practical tool to support the Haskell development
 process.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah uses GTK+ as GUI Toolkit with the gtk2hs binding.
 It is platform independent and should run on any platform where GTK+, gtk2hs
 and GHC can be installed.
 It uses the Cabal package management and build system for Package Management.
 It needs the Glasgow Haskell Compiler for full functionality (GHC).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This document is a reference to the functionality you can find in Leksah,
 it is not intended to be a tutorial.
 Since Leksah is in the state of development the information may be incomplete
 or even wrong.

Release Notes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.4 Beta Release February/March 2009
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The 0.4 Release is the first beta release of Leksah.
 It should be usable for practical work for the ones that wants to engage
 with it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It depends on GHC 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

6.10.1 and gtk2hs 
\begin_inset Formula $\geq$
\end_inset

 0.10.0.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The class pane and the history feature are not quite ready, so we propose
 not to use it yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Version 0.1 Alpha Release February 2008 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a pre-release of Leksah.
 The editor for Cabal Files is not ready, so we propose not to use it yet.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Installing Leksah
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\series bold
It is a good idea to install everything from sources when using Leksah
\series default
.
 Leksah can then use the output produced while building to give you much
 better Metadata.
 You will be able to see the source comments for functions while autocompleting
 and you will be able to look up the source of functions easily.
 Sadly, on 
\series bold
Windows
\series default
 it can be difficult to install GHC and Gtk2Hs from source and you may wish
 to install both using the binary installers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you have any trouble installing please check the Wiki, the mailing list
 or contact the developers to find a solution.
 If it is a Leksah problem, then it is important to us and needs to be fixed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\emph on
In the future we would like to have packages/installers for Linux distributions,
 Windows and Mac.
 Please contact us if you can offer help.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Generic Installation Instructions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Install GHC (Glasgow Haskell Compiler)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing Leksah supports only the most current version (6.10.1).
 For information about installing GHC go to 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://haskell.org/ghc
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Install Gtk2Hs
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing Leksah supports only the most current version (0.10.0).
 For information about installing Gtk2Hs got to 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://haskell.org/gtk2hs
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you are planning on installing a newer version, then you will need to
 make sure it is compatible with the version of GHC you have installed first.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On operating systems with a package manager you may wish to use a source
 os package and build a binary os package to install.
 You should be able to prevent the working directory from being cleaned,
 so it can be used for Leksah's Metadata.
 Doing this means that other os packages depending on Gtk2Hs can still easily
 be installed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you compile Gtk2Hs manually, check the output of ./configure.
 At the end it will list the haskell packages that are going to be build.
 Leksah needs gtk, glib and gtksourceview2.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Gtk2Hs conditionally compiles some code dependent of the version of the
 underlying Gtk libraries.
 This can cause strange compiler errors when compiling leksah later.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Install Cabal
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At the time of writing Leksah requires at least version 1.6.0.1.
 For information about installing Gtk2Hs got to 
\begin_inset Flex URL
status open

\begin_layout Plain Layout

http://haskell.org/cabal
\end_layout

\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
On operating systems with package managers you may find that a Cabal package
 is avaliable.
 Once again if you want good Metadata for the Cabal functions, try to build
 binaries on your machine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection

 with typical Cabal procedure.
 (Go to the root folder of the package.
 Then do 
\emph on
runhaskell configure, runhaskell build, sudo runhaskell install
\emph default
.
 The other packages needed should have been installed with GHC anyway.
 (I'm nut sure if GHC-extralibs is needed).
 Then get the leksah package via hackage and do the same.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Where Things Are Installed
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah installs a an executable in a folder that should be in the search
 path, and a couple of data files in a data folder.
 These places are chosen by the Cabal package management system and depend
 on the target platform and the way you install.
 On Linux the data folder may be
\emph on
 /usr/share/leksah-0.4/data.
 
\emph default
For storing preferences, sessions and collected meta-data Leksah constructs
 a .leksah directory in your home folder.
 If you want to change or add configuration files for keymaps, source candy,
 etc, you can put them in this place.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection

 If there are any that are not going to be installed that you would like,
 then you most likely need to install the corresponding -devel ubuntu package.

 (Figure 1) You have to specify folders, under which Haskell source code
 for installed packages can be found.
 This can be any folder above the source directories.
 So figure out what this will be on your system.
 You have to click the Add Button after selecting the folder.
 If you use cabal install add the cabal install package directory to the

Now Leksah collects information about all installed packages on your system.
 So it may take some time, but at further starts leksah will only collect
 information if new packages have been installed.
 Their will eventually be a bunch of errors on your command line, but don't
 worry, it only means that Leksah has not succeeded to extract the source
 locations and comments for certain modules or packages.

The central functionality needed for development is to edit Haskell source
 files.
 Leksah uses the GtkSourceView2 widget for this.
 It provides syntax highlighting, undo/redo and other features.
 In the file menu (Figure 4) you have the usual functionality to open, save,
 close and revert files.
 You can as well close all files, and all files which are not stored in
 or below the top folder of the current project (this is the folder where
 the .cabal file resides).
 Leksah does not store backup files.
 Leksah detects if a file has changed which is currently edited and queries
 the user if a reload is desired.
 When you open a file which is already open, leksah queries if you want
 to make the currently open file active, instead of opening it a second
 time (Leksah does not support multiple views on a file, but if you open
 a file a second time, its like editing the file two times, which makes
 little sense).

 If you want to change to a different buffer you can open a list of all
 open buffers by pressing the right mouse button, while the mouse is over
 a notebook tab.
 You can then select an entry in this list to select this file.

In the edit menu (Figure 5) you find the usual operations: undo, redo, cut,
 copy, paste and select all.
 In addition you can comment and un-comment selected lines in a per line
 style (--).
 Furthermore you can align some special characters (=,<-,->,::,|) in selected
 lines.
 The characters are never moved to the left, but the operation is very simple
 and takes the rightmost position of the special character in all lines,
 and inserts spaces before the first occurrence of this special characters
 in the other lines for alignment.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Search and Replace
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah supports basic functionality for searching in text files.
 When you select Edit/Find from the menu the find bar will open (Figure
 6) and you can type in a text string.
 Hitting the up and down arrow will bring you to the next/previous occurrence
 of the search string.
 Hitting Enter will close the find bar and place the cursor at the currently
 selected search position.
 Hitting Escape will close the find bar.
 You have options for case sensitive search, for searching only whole worlds
 and for wrapping around, which means that the search will start at the
 beginning/end of the file, when the end/beginning is reached.
 If their is no occurrence of the search string the entry turns red.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When using Source Candy, Leksah reads and writes pure ASCII Code files,
 but can nevertheless show you nice symbols like 
\begin_inset Formula $\lambda.$
\end_inset

This is done by replacing certain character combinations by a Unicode character
 when loading a file or when typing, and replace it back when the file is
 saved.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The use of the candy feature can be switched on and off in the menu and
 the preferences dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This feature can be configured by editing a .candy file in the .leksah folder
 or in the data folder.
 The name of the candy file to be used can be specified in the Preferences
 dialog.
\end_layout

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first entry in a line are the characters to replace.
 The second entry is the hexadecimal representation of the Unicode character
 to replace with.
 The third entry is an optional argument, which specifies, that the replacement
 should add and remove blanks to keep the number of characters.
 This is important because of the layout feature of Haskell.
 The last entry in the line is an optional comment, which is by convention
 the name of the Unicode character.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the source candy feature can give you problems with layout, because
 the alignment of characters with and without source candy may differ!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah reads and writes files encoded in UTF-8.
 So you can edit Unicode Haskell source files.
 When you want to do this, switch of source candy, because otherwise Unicode
 characters may be converted to ASCII when saving the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Completion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah has the ability to auto complete identifiers in text you type.
 Additionally the Package, Module and Type of the id gets displayed if selected.
 This completion mode can either be always on, or only be activated on pressing
 Ctrl+Space.
 You can choose between these two possibilities in the Preferences.

 Some of the options you find here refer to visual elements, like the display
 of line numbers, the font used, the display of a right margin and the use
 of a style file for colors and syntax highlighting.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can set here the Tab size you want.
 Leksah always stores tabs as spaces to ease the use of layout.
 (As you may know, otherwise only a tab size of 8 can be digested by Haskell
 compilers).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah has an option for storing the files with standard UNIX line ends
 even on Windows, and not using the infamous Cr/Lf combination.
 This is e.g.
 useful if Windows and other users commit to the same repository.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah offers as well to remove trailing blanks in lines, which you may
 choose as default, because blanks at the end of lines make no sense in

\end_inset

A central concept for any IDE is a package, which is a project for development
 of some library or executable you may work on.
 One instance of Leksah can only open one package at a time.
 Leksah can store configurations for packages separately (and does this
 by default), so that you can switch between packages and get exactly back
 to where you stopped when opening a different package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah uses Cabal for package management, and opening a package is done
 by opening a cabal file.
 So when you select Package / Open Package from the menu, select the cabal
 file of the desired package.
 Leksah shows the current package in the third compartment in the status
 bar!
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start with a new package select Package / NewPackage from the menu.
 Then you have to select a folder for the project, which you may give the
 same name you will give to your package.
 Then the package editor will open up, in which you have to supply information
 about your package.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Package Editor
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The package editor (Figure 10) is an editor for cabal files.
 Since cabal files offer complex options the editor is quite complex.
 For a complete description of all options see the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Cabal User's Guide"
target "http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/Cabal/index.html"

\end_inset

.
 The package editor does not support the cabal configurations feature.
 If you need cabal configurations, you need to edit the cabal files as a
 text file.
 Since Leksah uses standard cabal files with no modifications this is no
 problem, and you can use Leksah with such packages with no problem, just
 the package editor will not work for you.

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The minimum requirements for any package is to give a name and a version.
 Then you will have to enter dependencies on other packages in the Dependencies
 part of the editor.
 This will be at least the base package.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally you have to specify an executable or a library that should be the
 result of your coding effort.
 You do this in the Executables and Library part of the editor.
 Cabal gives the possibility to build more then one executable from one
 package and to build a library and executables from one package.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For an executable you enter a name, the source file with the main function
 and a build info.
 For a library you enter the exposed modules and a build info.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With build information you give additional 
\begin_inset space \space{}
\end_inset

information, e.g: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
where the sources can be found (relative to the root folder of the project,
 which is the one with the cabal file).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
what additional non-exposed or non main modules your project includes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
compiler flags
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
used language extensions in addition to Haskell 98 (These can also be specified
 in the source files with pragmas)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
and many more ...
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Because more then one executable and a library can be build from one package,
 it is possible to have cabal files with more then one build info.
 The package editor deals with this by the buttons Add / Remove Build Info.
 Every build info gets an index number, and for executables and a library
 you specify the index of the build info.
 (However, the usual case is to start with one build info).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Building
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most frequently used functionality with packages is to make a build,
 which is possible after a successful configure.
 When you start a build, the log window will be opened or displayed.
 In the Log window you can see the standard output the Cabal build produces,
 which comes from the GHC compiler.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A build may produce errors and warnings.
 If this is the case the focus is set to the first error/warning in the
 Log and the corresponding source file will open with the focus at the point
 where the compiler reports the error.
 You can navigate to the next or previous errors by clicking on the error
 or warning in the log window, or by using the menu, the toolbar or a keystroke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the statusbar the state regarding to the build is displayed in the third
 compartment from the right.
 It reads 
\emph on

 warnings after a build.

Import Helper
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A frequent and annoying error is the 
\emph on

\emph default
 compiler error.
 In the majority of cases it means that an import statement is missing.
 If this is the case you can choose 
\emph on
Add import 
\emph default
from the context menu in the log pane.
 Leksah will then add an import statement to the import list.
 If their is more then one module the identifier can be imported from, a
 dialog will appear which queries you about the module you want to import
 from (Figure 11).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah then adds a line or an entry to the import list of the affected module
 with the compiler error and adds a line in the Log window.
 Leksah imports individual elements, but imports all elements of a class
 or data structure if one of them is needed.
 The import helper can work with qualified identifiers and should add a
 correct import statement.
 You can as well select 
\emph on
add all imports
\emph default
 from the context menu, in which case all 
\emph on
Not in scope 
\emph default
errors
\emph on
 
\emph default
will be treated at once.
 After providing the imports you have to save the file and recompile.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The import helper just looks in imported packages, so if you miss a package
 import it will not be treated automatically.
 If you find that an identifier is not exported by another module and you
 add it their and then run the import helper again, it will still not find
 the identifier, because the meta information the import mechanism depends
 on was not updated.
 So choose Metadata / Update project and choose add import again and it
 should work.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Obviously some not in scope errors have other reasons, e.g.
 you have misspelled some identifier, which can't be resolved by adding
 imports.

As you can see in the package menu (Figure 9) you can do more operations
 with packages, which are mostly provided by the Cabal system.
 You can clean, configure, build and if you have build an executable run
 your program.
 And other operations like building a source distribution and building haddock
 documentation.
 For more details about these operations (as said before) consult the 
\begin_inset CommandInset href
LatexCommand href
name "Cabal User's Guide"
target "http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/Cabal/index.html"

\end_inset

.
 Since many of these operations can take additional flags you can enter
 these by selecting Package / Edit flags.
 Then the Flags pane opens up (Figure 12).
 For example haddock documentation for the leksah source will not be build,
 because it is not a library unless you pass the --executable flag.
 The flags are stored in a file called IDE.flags in the root folder of the
 project.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Navigation and Metadata
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah collects data about all installed Haskell packages on your system.
 It does this by reading the Haskell interface files which GHC writes.
 In addition it adds source positions and comments of packages for which
 a cabal file with the corresponding source files can be found.
 The package you work on is treated differently, as not only external exported
 entities are collected, but all exports from all modules are collected.
 This makes it possible to get information about identifiers: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Which packages and modules export this identifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
What is the type of the exported identifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the source is found: What is the comment for this identifier?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If the source is found: What is the implementation?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you like to get information about some identifier in the code, the easiest
 way is to press Ctrl and double click on it.
 If the id is known unambiguously the modules and info pane will show informatio
n about it.
 If more then one possibility exist the search pane will open and present
 the alternatives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More precisely the operation is not triggered by the double click operation,
 but by the release of the left button.
 So if the double click does not select the right area for a special id
 like ++ you can select the desired characters with the left button and
 then release it while you hold down the Ctrl key.

Currently Leksah only uses the collected

 metadata, and does not know what the Haskell compiler knows about your
 code.
 So definitions which are local to a module will not be found, types of
 variables which are not exported will not be known, and Leksah does not
 known about which definition is the one you are looking for, because it
 is the only imported one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Plain Layout
We will work on adding this information in the future, but we started with
 the

 approach from the intuition, that it takes most of our time to find something

If the Blacklist toggle button is selected, the packages in the blacklist
 are not displayed.
 This doesn't mean that the information of this packages is not loaded or

 (I invented the blacklist mainly for the GHC package, which is very big
 and does not use name-spaces and so pollutes the list).
 The Blacklist can be edited in the preferences dialog.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select a module in the modules list, its interface is displayed in
 the interface list on the right.
 You can search for a module or package by selecting the modules list and
 typing some text.
 With the up and down arrows you find the next/previous matching item.
 With the escape key or by selecting any other GUI element you leave the
 search mode.
 If there is a little icon with a text in front of a module, Leksah has
 found a source file for this module.
 You can open this source file, or bring it to the front if it is already
 open with a 
\emph on

 It shows the identifier, the package and module that it is exported by,
 it's Haskell type and if possible a comment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select an identifier in an editor, and their is information about
 this identifier available in the package scope, it is automatically displayed

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can search for a string by typing in characters in the entry at the
 bottom of the pane.
 The search result depends on the settings in the search pane (Figure 16).
 You can choose:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The scope in which to search, which can be local, package or system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The way the search is executed, which can be exact, prefix or as a regular
 expression.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
You can choose if the search shall be case sensitive or not.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The result of the search is displayed in the list part of the Search pane.
 You can see the sort of expression by the icon before the identifier.
 You can see if the module reexports the identifier, or if the source of
 the identifier is reachable.
 When you single click on a search result, the info pane shows the corresponding
 information.
 If you double click on an entry, the modules and info pane shows the correspond
ing information.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you double click on an identifier and press Ctrl in a source buffer,
 it is a case sensitive and exact search in the package scope.
 So this does not depend on the selection in the search pane, even if the
 result is displayed in the list box of the search pane.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the info pane you can click the button Refs, if you want to explore which
 modules import the selected element.

Metadata collection depends on the configuration and can be manually triggered.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select Metadata / Update Project the metadata for the current project
 is collected from the .hi files and the source files.
 You should select this if the metadata of the current project is out of
 sync.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you select Metadata / Update Lib Leksah checks if a new library has installed
 and if this is the case collects metadata for it.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the Metadata part of the preferences (Figure 9) you can edit the settings
 concerning metadata collection.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Metadata collection is a critical point, because it depends on the installation,
 environment, the installed packages, etc.
 However, to make good use of leksah it is highly desirable to have metadata
 with sources available for the packages you really need.
 So here we explain how metadata collection works:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Since cabal install has sources only as compressed tar archives on your
 machine, leksah needs to unpack this.
 You can see if this works by browsing the folders.
 You can initiate this step by calling leksah -x - n.
 If only root has write access to some cabal packages do a: sudo leksah
 -x -n (--Extract --NoGui).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Now leksah looks for all cabal files it can find below the source folders.
 From this information the file source_packages.txt in the .leksah folder
 is written.
 If you miss sources for a package in Leksah, consult this file if the source
 place of the package has been correctly found.
 You can run this step by: leksah -s -n (--Sources --NoGui).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The metadata collection itself proceeds in two steps: A) Extract info from
 .hi files, which is usually no problem.
 B) Add source locations and comments by parsing the sources.
 This can be a problem because of preprocessing, header files, language
 extensions, etc.
 The result is stored in a folder under the .leksah folder (under your home
 folder).
 The folder will be named after the compiler version (e.g.
 ghc-6.8.1).
 In this folder for every package a metadata file is stored (e.g.
 binary-0.4.1.pack).
 These files are in binary format.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

You can rebuild the whole metadata when you start Leksah with the -r -n
 option (--Rebuild --NoGui).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

You can update the metadata with: leksah -c -n (--Collect --NoGui)
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

If you have a problem with a certain package, remove its metadata file ,
 e.g.
 rm ~/.leksah-ghc-.../binary*.
 And then do a collect: leksah -c -n.
 Look for error messages in the Console to see if some problem is reported.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
For the current package a slightly different procedure is used, because
 leksah not only looks for exported library entities, but for all exports
 of every module.
 The written metadata file has the extension .packw.
 (We plan to replace this by using only GHC-API for querying metadata for
 the current package dynamically.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Configuration
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah is highly customizable.
 Here it is explained how this works.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In Leksah there may be an active pane.
 The name of this pane is displayed in the second compartment from the left
 side in the status bar.
 Some actions like moving, splitting, closing panes or finding or replacing
 items in a text buffer act on the current pane, so check the display in
 the status bar to see if the pane you want to act on is really active.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layout of the Leksah window contains areas which contain notebooks which
 contain so called panes.
 The division between the two areas is adjustable by the user by dragging
 a handle.
 The areas form a binary tree, although this tree is not visible to the
 user.
 Every area can be split horizontally or vertically.
 Panes can collapsed, the effect of collapsing depends on the position of
 the pane in the binary layout tree.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Active panes can be moved between areas in the window.
 The tabs of notebooks can be positioned at any of the four directions,
 or the tabs can be switched off.
 Note that holding the mouse over the tabs and selecting the right button
 brings up a menu of all panes in this area, so that you can for example
 quickly select one of many open source buffers.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The layout will be saved with sessions.
 The session mechanism will be explained in the next section.
 Currently there is no way to load different layouts independent of the
 other data stored in a sessions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the GUI Options part of the Preferences (Figure 21), you can configure
 options regarding the layout, namely were windows of certain types are
 opened.

You can change the active pane using a keyboard shortcut to bring up the
 flipper.
 It lists the most recently used panes first so they are easier to get to.
 The default shortcuts for the flipper are Ctrl+Tab and Ctrl+Shift+Tab or
 Ctrl+Page Down and Ctrl+Page Up.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When you close Leksah the current state is saved in the file Current.session
 in the ~/.leksah folder.
 A session contains the layout of the window, its population, the active
 package and some other state.
 When you restart Leksah it recovers the state from this information.
 When you close a package, the session is saved in the project folder in
 the file IDE.session.
 When you open a project and Leksah finds a IDE.session file in the folder
 of the project you are going to open, you get prompted if you want to open
 this session.
 This should help you to switch between different packages you are working
 on.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Beside of this you have the possibility to store and load named sessions
 manually by using the session menu.
 Actually you may live well without using this feature.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can as well choose to mark Forget Session, if you don't want the current
 session to be stored.
 This can be useful, if something goes wrong (e.g.
 you hit accidentally Ctrl - 0 and the layout collapses completely).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Shortcuts
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
You can configure the keystrokes by providing a .keymap file, which can either
 be in the .leksah folder or in the data folder.
 The name of the key map file to be used can be specified in the Preferences
 dialog.
 A line in the .keymap file looks like:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<ctrl>o -> FileOpen "Opens an existing file"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Allowed Modifiers are <shift> <ctrl> <alt> <apple> <compose>.
 <apple> is the Windows key on PC keyboards.
 <compose> is often labeled Alt Gr.
 It is as well possible to specify Emacs like keystrokes in the following
 way:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
<ctrl>x/<ctrl>f -> FileOpen "Opens an existing file"
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The comment on the right will be displayed as tool tips on top of toolbar
 buttons, if such exist for this action.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The name of the action can be any one of the 
\emph on
ActionDescr's
\emph default
 given in the 
\emph on
action
\emph default
 function in the Module 
\emph on
IDE.Menu
\emph default
.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Whenever you call an action, by a menu, a toolbar or a keystroke, the keystroke
 with its associated ActionsString is displayed in the Status bar in the
 leftmost compartment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every keystroke shall obviously only be associated with one action, and
 more important every action may only have one associated keystroke.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Simple keystrokes are shown in the menu, but Emacs like keystrokes are not.
 This is because simple keystrokes are delegated to the standard gtk mechanism,
 while other keystrokes are handled by Leksah.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Configuration files
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Leksah stores its configuration in a directory called ~/.leksah under your
 home folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The file Default.prefs stores the general Preferences.
 These Preferences can be edited in a dialog by choosing Help/Edit Prefs
 from the menu.
 If this file is not available the Default.prefs file from the installed
 /data folder will be used.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Current.session file stores the state of the last session, so that Leksah
 will recover the state from the last session.
 If this file is not available it will be taken from the installed /data
 folder.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The source_packages.txt file stores source locations for installed packages.
 It can be rebuild by calling Leksah with the -s or --Sources argument .
 Do this after you moved your source or added sources for previous installed
 packages without sources.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The folder will contain one or many other folders (e.g.
 ghc-6.8.1).
 In this folder collected information about installed packages for a compiler
 version is stored.
 (e.g.
 binary-0.4.1.pack).
 These files are in binary format.
 If you start Leksah with the -r or --Rebuild argument, it cleans all .pack
 files and rebuilds everything.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Files for Keymaps and SourceCandy may be stored here and will be found according
 to the name selected in the Preferences Dialog.
 Leksah first searches in this folder and after this in the /data folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Menus and Toolbars

\begin_layout Standard
Menus and Toolbars can be customized by editing the file Default.

 The format is a gtk+ xml format.
 Leksah requires the definition of one menu bar and one toolbars in this
 order.
 The names of the actions can be all in the
