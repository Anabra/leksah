Leksah, an Integrated Development Environment for Haskell
=========================================================

This is Leksah, a hopefully practical tool to support the Haskell development process.
The development has been started because no such tools were available at this time.

The development of an IDE is a big issue, so Ghf is intended to become a
community project and everyone is invited to contribute.

If you are a user or just test Ghf, we would appreciate to here from you
and problems and wishes for Ghf.

Ghf uses GTK+ as GUI Toolkit with the gtk2hs binding. It is plattform independend
and should run on any plattform where GTK+, gtk2hs and ghc can be installed.
It is currently been tested on Windows and Linux. It uses the Cabal package management
and build system for Package Management.
It currently only supports the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc).

Documentation can be found in the doc/ subdirectory.

Please send questions and suggestions to me:

System Requirements
===================

Haddock currently requires GHC version 6.6 or 6.8 to compile.
