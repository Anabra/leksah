Leksah, an Integrated Development Environment for Haskell
=========================================================

This is Leksah, a hopefully practical tool to support the Haskell development process.

Leksah uses GTK+ as GUI Toolkit with the gtk2hs binding. It is plattform independend
and should run on any plattform where GTK+, gtk2hs and ghc can be installed.
It is currently been tested on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. It uses the Cabal package management
and build system for Package Management. It currently only supports the Glasgow Haskell Compiler (ghc).

Documentation can be found on leksah.org.

System Requirements
===================

Leksah currently requires:
    GHC version 6.10.x-6.12
    gtk2hs 0.10.x-
    other dependencies see cabal file

If you are a user or just test Leksah, we would appreciate to here from you.

Please send questions and suggestions to the developers
